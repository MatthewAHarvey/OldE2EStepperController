# OldE2EStepperController

Code for the stepper motor controller based on an Arduino Mega that is used in the old (e,2e) spectrometer. The arduino positions the spectrometer's analysers at set angles using feedback from potentiometers. It also monitors photo-interrupters and emergency stops the steppers to prevent crashes. The arduino handles acceleration and deceleration ramps and can provide continous monitoring information to a connnected computer.

LabVIEW FGV included.
